I don't take credit for those scripts.

If you want to see owner of script, just google it
Ex: loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://arches-systems.com/loader.lua",true))()
Google "Arches-systems script roblox" and you're done.

This repository ONLY for me! I don't want to someone use this. 
I'm not making it's private due of loadstring for some scripts. "If some scripts aren't loadstring, but obfuscated"
